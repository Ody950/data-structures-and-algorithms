# Graph-Breadth-First
When a dead end occurs during any one of the iterations, the Breadth First Search (BFS) algorithm will remember to obtain the next vertex to begin a search, using a queue.

## Challenge
Extend your graph object with a breadth-first traversal method that accepts a starting node. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return a collection of nodes in the order they were visited. Display the collection.


## Approach & Efficiency
* Big O Space = O(n)
* Big O Time = O(n)
