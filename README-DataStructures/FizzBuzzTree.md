Trees are a powerful data structure with many applications. Trees are used in computer science for various tasks, including storing information, representing hierarchical data, and providing efficient algorithms for operations such as insertion, deletion, and searching.

## Challenge

### Write a function called breadth first

Write a function called fizz buzz tree
- Arguments: k-ary tree
- Return: new k-ary tree

Determine whether or not the value of each node is divisible by 3, 5 or both. Create a new tree with the same structure as the original, but the values modified as follows:

- If the value is divisible by 3, replace the value with “Fizz”
- If the value is divisible by 5, replace the value with “Buzz”
- If the value is divisible by 3 and 5, replace the value with “FizzBuzz”
- If the value is not divisible by 3 or 5, simply turn the number into a String.
### Implementing:

- Fizz Buzz Tree

## Approach & Efficiency

### Trees max

Time -->  O(n)

Space -->  O(n)

The input is a k-ary tree with n nodes. The most expensive operation is the loop that iterates over the queue of nodes, which has a maximum size of n.
